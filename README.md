# Time-Dependent Temperature and Pressure Calculation in a Piston Engine

## Overview
This Python script calculates the **time-dependent temperature and pressure** inside a **4-stroke IC engine cylinder** at every **10-degree crankshaft rotation** for an engine running at **1000 RPM**. The results are saved in an Excel file.

## Methodology
The calculations are based on thermodynamic equations that model the compression, combustion, and expansion phases of the cycle.

### 1. **Compression & Expansion Process** (Polytropic Process)
- The temperature and pressure during compression and expansion are calculated using the **polytropic relations**:
  - **Temperature:** \( T V^{(n-1)} = \text{constant} \)
  - **Pressure:** \( P V^n = \text{constant} \)
  - Where **n** (polytropic index) is **1.35**.

### 2. **Combustion Process** (Weibe Function Approximation)
- The combustion phase between **360° and 390° crank angle** is approximated using the **Weibe function**.

### 3. **Crankshaft Rotation & Time Calculation**
- **1000 RPM** means **16.67 revolutions per second**.
- Since one cycle is **720°**, the time per degree step is computed.
- Time for each **10-degree step** is calculated as:
  \[ t = \frac{\theta}{\omega} \]
  where \( \omega \) is angular velocity.

## Code Details
- **Engine Parameters:**
  - Ambient Temperature = **350 K**
  - Peak Temperature = **1026.85 K**
  - Atmospheric Pressure = **101325 Pa**
  - Peak Pressure during Combustion = **3.5 MPa**
- **Cylinder Geometry:**
  - Bore = **80 mm**, Stroke = **80 mm**, Compression Ratio ≈ **10:1**.
- **Output File:**
  - The calculated values are stored in **`time_dependent_temp_pressure_1000RPM.xlsx`**.

## How to Run the Script
1. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas openpyxl
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python temp_pressure_1000RPM_script.py
   ```
3. The **Excel file** will be generated in the same directory.

## Output File Format
The **Excel file** contains:
| Crank Angle (deg) | Time (s) | Temperature (K) | Pressure (Pa) |
|-------------------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| 0                | 0.00000 | 350.0          | 101325.0     |
| 10               | 0.01667 | 365.4          | 110500.2     |
| ...              | ...     | ...            | ...          |
| 720              | 0.72000 | 350.0          | 101325.0     |
